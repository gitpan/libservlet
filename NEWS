  libservlet 0.9.1 is released!

  This is the first public version of libservlet. You can't do much
  with it yet, since no Perl servlet containers exist yet. However, I
  wanted to get some eyeballs on it, and it would be great if somebody
  got excited enough to volunteer help. There are a few outstanding
  issues and some documentation work needs to be done. 95% of the work
  is done tho, which means I can turn my attention back to Wombat and
  hopefully get a working container released in the next week or so.

  For more information, see http://www.maz.org/libservlet/. A mailing
  list has been created - mailto:libservlet-subscribe@maz.org.
  Feedback is most certainly welcome!
